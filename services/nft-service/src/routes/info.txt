Error Handling: Implement centralized error handling to catch application errors and send the appropriate response to the client.

Rate Limiting: Protect your endpoints from abuse using rate limiting.

API Versioning: It's a good practice to version your API from the beginning.

CORS: If you're building an API that will serve a frontend on a different domain, handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

Logging: Add a logging mechanism to track incoming requests and errors. This helps in debugging and auditing.

Request Body Parsing: If you're going to handle POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, you'll need a middleware to parse the request body.

Security Headers: Use helmet to help set some HTTP headers for security.

Compression: Use compression to compress response bodies for all request that traverse through the middleware.

Environment-Specific Middleware: For instance, in a development environment, you might want a more verbose error stack trace.

JWT Authentication & Authorization: If your application requires authentication and authorization, consider adding middleware for JWT (JSON Web Tokens) verification and role-based access controls.

Environment-specific logging: Adjust the logging level and format depending on the environment (development, production, etc.).

File Uploads: If your application allows users to upload files or images, consider integrating multer for handling multipart/form-data.

Caching: Use caching mechanisms like express-cache-controller or integrate with in-memory databases like Redis using express-redis-cache.

Database Connection: Integrate a middleware to check the health/status of your database connection.

Validation and Sanitization: Use express-validator to validate and sanitize request inputs.

Request ID: Use express-request-id to assign a unique ID to each request, which can be helpful in debugging.

Response Time: Log how long each request takes using response-time.

Serving Static Files: If you're serving static files, like images, styles, or scripts, use express.static.

Session Management: If you need sessions, integrate express-session.

Cross-Domain Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration: Depending on the frontend setup, you might need to configure CORS to allow certain origins, methods, and headers.

CSRF Protection: If your application has forms, consider adding CSRF protection using csurf.

Favorites or Bookmarks Routes: If users can mark NFTs as favorites or save them for later.

Comments or Reviews Routes: If users can comment on or review NFTs.

Collections Routes: If there are specific collections of NFTs that users or artists can create.

Notifications Routes: To manage user notifications related to their activities.

Analytics Routes: If you provide analytics or insights to artists or users about NFT views, popularity, sales, etc.

Support or Feedback Routes: If users can submit feedback or reach out for support.

Activities or Feed Routes: If you provide a feed of activities like "John just purchased an NFT".

Settings or Configuration Routes: For users to manage platform-specific settings.

404 Not Found Route: Always good to have a catch-all route at the very end to handle non-existing routes.

User Routes: Routes related to user operations.

Authentication Routes: Routes related to user authentication, like signup, login, logout.

Order Routes: Routes related to the purchase or sale of NFTs.

Admin Routes: If you have admin-specific functionalities.

Profile Routes: For user profiles.

Search Routes: For searching NFTs or other entities.

Health Check: It's often good to have a simple health check endpoint.
