Smart Contract Logic for NFT Tickets:

Ticket Quantity Limit: Implement logic to restrict the number of tickets one user can purchase. This will require:

Recording and verifying the buyer's address.
Tracking the number of tickets associated with each address for each event.




Resale Restrictions:

Ensure the ticket's smart contract allows transferability so that users can resell the ticket if they want.
Implement logic to check the current date/time against the event date/time.
If the current date/time is before the event, restrict resale price to the initial sale price.
After the event's date/time has passed, remove the resale price restriction.




Ensure Authenticity: 

Use the smart contract to verify the authenticity of the NFT ticket, ensuring that only legitimate tickets are recognized by the platform.

Understand potential pitfalls and best practices for NFT ticketing.
Choose an appropriate blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum, Flow, etc.).

Thoroughly test the smart contract, especially for edge cases.
